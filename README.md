# Clustering_Project

### In a nutshell, the client is selling its products through partnered merchants. The payment minus merchant's commission will be collected by the client at the end of each week. There has always been a constant wave of delinquent retailers that are unable to make their payments within the invoice closing date. This takes a financial toll on the Client and has amounted to a 6-figure loss on a yearly basis for at least the past 3 years. It stands as an imperative mission for the Client to figure out the tendencies of these retailers so they can better prepare for the future and minimize loss where possible. Using several machine learning models, I was able to deduce specific trends and ‘rules’ of these delinquent retailers.

### To solve the problem and better understand the merchant's business characteristics, I used the methodology of retail profile. The main idea is to segment the sub-population from the existing merchant base, and from there, I created the different retailer personas with corresponding business characteristics.

### This project consists of Exploratory Data Analysis, correlation analysis of merchant's business characteristics, and k-means clustering for existing merchants.
